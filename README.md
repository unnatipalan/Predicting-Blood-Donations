# Predicting Blood Donations

Donating blood can save lives. The dataset here is obtained from a blood donation vehicle in Taiwan that drives to universities to collect blood. It collects data about the blood donor like the number of times they donated blood, to try and predict if they would donate blood again. This project is part of the DataCamp Projects. We use a machine learning classifier to predict if a donor would donate blood again.
